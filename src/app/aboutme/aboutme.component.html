            Hi, I'm a Frontend-Developer based in Twist, Lower Saxony, Germany. To advance my skills in webdevelopment, I attended an extensive coding-academy, where I learned professional operating principles in programming. During the time I developed various web apps, from responsive websites to business applications and jump-and-run Games. <br>
            You're welcome to visit and test my projects.

                        In my previous positions I was responsible for the optimization of existing as well as the development of new business processes and possible implementation of new ERP systems. However, never for the actual implementation. Now I am taking the next step and starting my coding-journey.
